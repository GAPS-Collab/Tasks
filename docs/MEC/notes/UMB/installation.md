There are 4 main components to installing the Umbrella.

1. Installing the RATs
2. Installing the TOF panels
3. Routing cables from Panels to RATs
4. Routing RAT to TOF-SYS "umbilical" cables through the Umbrella

I recommend installing RATs before any of the TOF panels, and the
remaining major components (2-4) should be installed in an order where
the installer still has access.  Typically one would mount the TOF panel
and then route all the relevant cables from the panel to the associated
RAT.  The umbilical cables need to routed across the UMB frame and
down the diagonals of the UMB frame.
