# Can a 90deg OHP connector fit at the top of the TKR?

Ref. Issue/PR: #182

## Outline

If an OHP is damaged inside the Tracker such that the straight
section needs replacing, then a 90deg 
[Swagelok #SS-3M0-9](https://products.swagelok.com/en/c/90-degree-elbows/p/SS-3M0-9) 
fitting needs to be used to join the new section to the bent 
section above Layer 0 of the Tracker.  So, **is there enough 
room between the Layer 0 cooling collar and the top of the 
Tracker (bottom of TOF) for Swagelok fitting to fit?**

## Answer

There does appear to be just enough room for the fitting to fit.
There would be about a .37" gap between the collar and the
fitting, and about a .44" gap between the fitting and TOF panel.
Obviously a fitted foam piece will need to be made to protect
the fitting from the TOF panel and visa-versa.

While there is enough vertical space for the fitting, there is
NOT enough space between neighboring OHPs.  If a fitting in
placed in an area congested with OHPs, then that fitting will
push against neighboring OHPs. (see pic below)
